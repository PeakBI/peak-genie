- Access the service/pod directly on local by port forwarding (kubectl port-forward deployment/peak-genie 8080:8000/ kubectl port-forward service/peak-genie-service 8080:8000)
- I created an ingress and it exposed a private ip through which i can access my service with VPN (I can directly access my ClusterIp service endpoint instead using VPN, why create an ingress for this ?)
- I created a load balancer service and it exposed a public ip through which i can access my service without VPN
  - It created a classic LB, should i move to alb and how?
  - won't it be expensive?
- Create helm chart ?
- slack endpoint won't work without redis/celery setup?
